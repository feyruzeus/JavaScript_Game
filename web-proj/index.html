        Once upon a time, there was a king, who had a beautiful daughter. The princess had a lot of wooer, and a king was struggling whom to choose. Finally an idea came into his mind. The castle had a magical maze, where the rooms can change their positions. There are treasures hidden in the rooms, and whichever wooer collects his treasures first, he wins the princess's hand.
        <br>
        The rooms int maze are symbolized by a 7x7 square grid cells. For each room we know that which wall has a door. If there are two doors in the contact wall of two neighbouring rooms, you can go from one room to another. The even rows and columns in the grid can be slided, the other rooms are fixed throughout the game. By sliding the rooms in the grid, doors and passages open through which players can move in the maze. By cleverly sliding the rooms players try to find their way to the treasures. The first player to find all their treasures and return to the starting square is the winner.
